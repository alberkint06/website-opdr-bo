        <h3>history</h3>
        <p>
            A garage box in The Hague is the place where the adventure started in 2008,
            with two friends Hasan Tasdemir and Pascal Rappailles.
            The garage quickly became too small, after which they moved to a warehouse on an industrial estate.
            Unfortunately, the shed was not heated and everything had to be transferred to an empty Ministry of Agriculture in the middle of winter.
            When this building also had to be cleared out, the then collection of 10 arcade video games was stored with some spare parts in an old showroom for classic cars.
            Because there was no room to renovate or play with the cabinets, suitable space was looked for.
            <br><br>
            It was found in 2011 on the Cobaltstraat in Zoetermeer.
            There Hasan decided to rent the location with 4 friends and the adventure could grow into their own meeting place to practice their hobby and relax with a game.

            The game hall is set up very nice.
            Certainly the history of gaming to today's arcade experience.
            You get the feeling that you are in Japan because of the type of games and of course also arcade which has been imported directly from Japan (so no translation to English).
            <br><br>
            The only downside is,
            which, by the way, annoys me a bit
            that most arcades didn't work or a gun is missing which makes playing together impossible.
            Certainly 4/10 arcade are the second player ‚Äúout of order‚Äù.
            <br><br>
            f the game computers are all well maintained then it was definitely worth a 9 to a 10 for me.
            Now I give it a 7.

            Amazing experience.
            We have been here several times and every time there are new devices and new things to do.
            There is a wide choice of machines and there are display cabinets with old game stuff.
            Even for the girls there are very nice dance cabinets and for the kids it is already a paradise.
